# Password-Generator

## Description

This is a tool that anyone can use to help generate passwords for any login they may need. It lets users choose which types of characters they need to fulfill the criteria of the password as well as lets them select a length between 8 and 128 characters as to make their password as easy or as hard as they like, as well as to meet the criteria of the password needed. the page is simple and is just a button with a text box that displays the Password.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this webpage you start by clicking the button labeled "generate password", and then continue by answering all prompts provided to you after clicking the button. After you have answered all the prompts, a password that matches those prompts will be randomly generated and displayed in the text box above the button. After the password is displayed in the text box, users can then select the password and copy and paste it into their clipboard for use with the site they have chosen to create a password for.

## Credits

Pulled README from Pre-Work-Study-Guide in my own repositories.
Used activity code from gitlab repository to reference best practices for using arrays to keep track of large data sets, also used these activity codes to form my functions and loops so that the code could operate properly. Used MDN as a resource to understand how arrays function and what kinds of methods to use on my password arrays so that I could assign characters and so that I could add arrays together and form new arrays with those arrays. Also used MDN as a reference for how Math.random functions so that each passwprd would be generated randomly. ccooperated and helped fellow classmate Sean Brown with his assignment.
